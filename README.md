# Tic-Tac-Toe

## About

Classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! You can choose for which 'symbol' you wanna play, and play against your friend localy! Also you can choose how big the field will be. In the future i wanna add game mode 'vs PC' and fix 5x5 mode!

## Current status

The application is still under development, I plan to refine it further.

2. Write a command in the console 'npm install http-server -g'.
3. Write a command in the console 'http-server' (this one starts your local server).
